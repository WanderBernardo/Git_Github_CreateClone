# Git and Github: Create and Clone Project
The goal this repository is show how create and clone project



### Create

1 - First, create one repository in the device (notebook) where it'll be to salve all project. I like of puting in the Disc "C". Because I think more difficult of delete for accident.

Remenber, organization is of your preference.

2 - Now, via command screen (bash), enter in the diretory created. In this case, diretory: GiHub Project

- Use command: ``` cd .. ```. Return root folder.
